#Terrafrom Template Repo

The purpose of this repo is to store boiler plate templates for Terraform deployments.
As new resources resources are created in Terraform, customer info can be removed from those templates and uploaded here to give anyone else needing to make a similar resource a starting point for their code. 

#Getting Started With Terraform

Read the OneWiki page:
https://one.rackspace.com/display/FSFA/Get+Started+with+Terraform

You can download Terraform from the following link: 
https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html 

This Microsoft Technet article is a great walkthough on how to get Terraform installed and configured.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/terraform-install-configure

I would also recommend going through Microsoft's turiotal on creating a VM with Terraform here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/terraform-create-complete-vm

To get a good understanding of how Terraform works prior to using any of these templates.
